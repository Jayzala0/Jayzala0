- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jayzala0 love working with automation testing and manual testing to make sure software works perfectly. I enjoy improving how we test software to make it faster and more efficient.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in automating tests using tools like Selenium and Cypress, as well as performance testing and API testing. I also care a lot about making sure software is tested properly by doing manual testing.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about testing in the API testing, performance testing, and security testing. I’m also exploring AI in testing to make testing smarter and faster.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source automation projects, test automation frameworks, and creating better CI/CD pipelines** for testing. I’m also interested in p**erformance testing** and improving **manual testing** processes.
